# Quiz 012
Similar to Quiz 011, this quiz was another blackbox. This one took me longer than it should've 😅. I hope I'll do better tomorrow!
The answer involved squaring input A then adding input B.
## Code

```py
def mystery_box(A:int, B:int):
    output = A**2 + B
    return output

case1 = mystery_box(37,3)
print(case1)
```
