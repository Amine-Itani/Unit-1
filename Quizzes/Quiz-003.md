# Quiz 003
## Protein Converter
I found this quiz pretty cool because it connected with real life examples and uses
We learned to use functions in this exercise as well, which really helped me keep everything organized
It was a little tough in the beginning though, as can be seen from all the scribbles
This quiz took in inputs (proteins) in "ATGC" and converts them to "TACG" respectively
