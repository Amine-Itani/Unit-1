# Quiz 022
Second quiz about data science using matplotlib. I've found it quite interesting so far, and especially useful. One of the most important reasons I'm passionate about computre science is for it's infinite tangible applications, and what we're studing in data science seems like the precipice of it all. This could be quite useful for the startup my grademate Ethan and myself are working on, which involves collecting a lot of satellite imagery over really big area (+ 100,000 ha!) to help reforestation efforts on the ground. I will need a lot more eperience to do so.

## Code

```py
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# crate the lists x and y
y = []
x = []
for num in range(-10, 10):
    x.append(num)
    y.append(2*((num + 5)**2))

plt.plot(x, y, 'r', linewidth=2)
plt.title("Graph of the equation $f(x)=2(x+5)^2$")
plt.xlabel("x", fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel("y", fontsize=18)
plt.show()
```
