# Quiz 013
This quiz is our third blackbox. I was quite worried since the last one was pretty challenging for me, but it was actually quite simple. I think I overthought it last time.

## Input

## Code

```py
def mysteryThree(A:str, B:str):
    output = ""
    for x in range(len(B)):
        output += A
    return output

out = mysteryThree('qwerty','lol lol')
print(out)
```
