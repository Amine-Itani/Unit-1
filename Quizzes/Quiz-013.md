# Quiz 013
This quiz is our third blackbox. I was quite worried since the last one was pretty challenging for me, but it was actually quite simple. I think I overthought it last time.<br>
This program took in two strings A and B, and printed A as many times as there were characters in B (not counting spaces!).

## Input & Ouput
**Not found on the quizzzes slideshow.**<br>
_Input:_ A:"qwerty" B:"lol lol"<br>
_Output_: "qwertyqwertyqwertyqwertyqwertyqwerty"

## Code

```py
def mysteryThree(A:str, B:str):
    output = ""
    for x in range(len(B)):
        output += A
    return output

out = mysteryThree('qwerty','lol lol')
print(out)
```
