# Quiz 011
This quiz was similar to a brain teaser. We were given inputs and their output through a mystery box (an algorithm we don't know). From that we figured out that a specfic mathematical equation was being employed to create those outputs that applied to all inputs

## Input & Output

## Code

```py
def mystery(A:int, B:int):
    # multiply B and A then subtract from that product (B - A)
    output = (B * A) - (B - A)
    return output


out = mystery(A=4, B=10)
print(out)
```
